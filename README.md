## Background

Symbolic mathematics, particularly solving integral equations, is a challenging task that requires sophisticated models capable of understanding and manipulating mathematical expressions. Traditional methods often struggle with the complexity and variability of symbolic forms. The `graph2tree` model addresses this by leveraging a GNN to understand the structure of mathematical expressions and a Tree LSTM encoder to efficiently generate correct symbolic equations.

## Features

- **Graph Neural Network (GNN):** Captures the structure of mathematical expressions represented as graphs.
- **Tree LSTM Encoder:** Encodes the graph into a tree structure, enabling the generation of more accurate symbolic equations.
- **Improved Accuracy:** Enhanced the base model to outperform other models in generating correct symbolic equations for integral problems.
- **Comparison with Other Models:** Benchmarked against existing models to demonstrate superior performance.
